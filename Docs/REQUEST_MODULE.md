# IT Request Module - Hospital Asset Tracking System

## üö® **N1 CRITICAL INTEGRATION MANDATE** üö®

### **Request Module: Demand Management Authority in Four-Module Maximum Efficiency System**

**This Request Module is the centralized demand management component of the N1 critical four-module integrated system.** It serves as the intelligent workflow orchestrator that MUST work in complete harmony with:

- **‚Üê‚Üí Asset Module**: Links requests to specific assets for maintenance/lifecycle management; receives status updates
- **‚Üê‚Üí Warehouse/Inventory Module**: Performs real-time availability checks; triggers immediate fulfillment when stock is available
- **‚Üê‚Üí Procurement Module**: Auto-generates purchase requests when inventory cannot fulfill demands; tracks procurement progress

### **Integration Requirements for Maximum Efficiency:**
- **Intelligent request routing** - Automatically determines fulfillment path (inventory, asset maintenance, or procurement)
- **Real-time availability checking** - Instant inventory verification before request processing
- **Automated workflow triggers** - Requests automatically initiate appropriate actions across all modules
- **Complete lifecycle visibility** - Full transparency from request creation through final fulfillment

**CRITICAL**: This Request Module is the demand orchestration engine of the integrated four-module system. It cannot achieve the N1 requirement of streamlined IT equipment request processes without full integration with Asset, Warehouse/Inventory, and Procurement modules. Operating independently will result in system failure to meet hospital operational efficiency objectives.

## üìã Overview

The IT Request Module serves as the central hub for all IT-related service requests within the hospital system. It provides a structured workflow for requesting IT equipment, services, and support while maintaining tight integration with asset tracking, inventory management, and procurement processes.

## üéØ Core Objectives

1. **Centralized Request Management** - Single point of entry for all IT requests
2. **Workflow Automation** - Streamlined approval and fulfillment processes
3. **Asset Integration** - Direct linking with existing assets and inventory
4. **Service Level Management** - Priority-based response and resolution tracking
5. **Complete Audit Trail** - Full tracking of request lifecycle

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Request Types
- **Hardware Requests** - New equipment, replacements, upgrades
- **Software Requests** - Installations, licenses, updates
- **Maintenance Requests** - Repairs, preventive maintenance, inspections
- **Support Requests** - Technical support, user training, consultations
- **Access Requests** - Network access, permissions, security clearances

### Priority Classification
- **Critical** (0-4 hours) - System down, security breach, patient safety impact
- **High** (24 hours) - Major functionality loss, multiple users affected
- **Medium** (48 hours) - Single user issues, non-critical functionality
- **Low** (1 week) - Enhancement requests, training, documentation

## üîÑ Business Process Flow

### 1. Request Initiation
```
User Request ‚Üí Auto-Classification ‚Üí Department Routing ‚Üí Asset Validation
```

### 2. Approval Workflow
```
Supervisor Review ‚Üí Department Head ‚Üí IT Assessment ‚Üí Budget Approval
```

### 3. Fulfillment Process
```
