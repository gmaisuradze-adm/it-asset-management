# Procurement Module - Hospital Asset Tracking System

## üö® **N1 CRITICAL INTEGRATION MANDATE** üö®

### **Procurement Module: Acquisition Authority in Four-Module Maximum Efficiency System**

**This Procurement Module is the acquisition and supply chain management component of the N1 critical four-module integrated system.** It serves as the external interface for bringing new resources into the hospital IT ecosystem and MUST work in complete harmony with:

- **‚Üê‚Üí Request Module**: Receives automated purchase requests when needs cannot be fulfilled internally; provides procurement status updates
- **‚Üê‚Üí Warehouse/Inventory Module**: Receives automated low-stock alerts; updates inventory immediately upon delivery confirmation
- **‚Üê‚Üí Asset Module**: Creates new asset records for all acquired equipment; initiates asset lifecycle management

### **Integration Requirements for Maximum Efficiency:**
- **Automated purchase triggering** - Low inventory levels and unfulfillable requests automatically generate purchase orders
- **Real-time procurement status** - All modules receive instant updates on purchase progress and delivery schedules
- **Seamless asset onboarding** - New equipment automatically enters asset management upon delivery acceptance
- **Integrated vendor management** - Vendor performance impacts future automated purchase decisions

**CRITICAL**: This Procurement Module is the external acquisition gateway for the integrated four-module system. It cannot achieve the N1 requirement of streamlined IT equipment processes without full integration with Request, Warehouse/Inventory, and Asset modules. Independent operation will result in procurement inefficiencies and failure to meet hospital operational objectives.
