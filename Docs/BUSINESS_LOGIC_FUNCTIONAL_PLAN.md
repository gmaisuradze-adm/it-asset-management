# Hospital IT Asset Tracking System - Business Logic & Functional Plan

## üö® **N1 CRITICAL INTEGRATION MANDATE - MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY** üö®

### **Four-Module Unified Operation: Non-Negotiable Requirement**

This Hospital IT Asset Tracking System is architected around the **N1 CRITICAL REQUIREMENT** that all four modules (Asset, Inventory/Warehouse, Request, and Procurement) **MUST work together in complete harmony for maximum efficiency**. This is the fundamental design principle that drives every aspect of the system architecture and implementation.

**System Success Depends On**: Complete integration of all four modules working as ONE unified solution to achieve streamlined IT equipment request processes and optimal business process design.

## üìã **INTEGRATED BUSINESS LOGIC FRAMEWORK**

### **1. ASSET MODULE - Lifecycle Authority**
**Core Responsibility**: Authoritative record and lifecycle management of all hospital IT assets

#### **Integration Points:**
- **‚Üê FROM Procurement**: Automatically receives new equipment upon delivery acceptance
- **‚Üí TO Request**: Triggers maintenance, repair, and replacement service requests
- **‚Üê FROM Inventory**: Receives components, parts, and supplies for maintenance
- **‚Üí TO Procurement**: Initiates replacement purchases based on lifecycle analysis

#### **Key Business Logic:**
- **Asset Lifecycle States**: New ‚Üí In Use ‚Üí Under Maintenance ‚Üí Repair Decision ‚Üí (Repaired/Write-Off/Replace)
- **Automatic Triggers**: End-of-life assets automatically generate replacement procurement requests
- **Maintenance Scheduling**: Predictive maintenance based on usage patterns and failure rates
- **Cost Tracking**: Total cost of ownership from acquisition through disposal

### **2. INVENTORY/WAREHOUSE MODULE - Supply Chain Authority**
**Core Responsibility**: Optimal stock management of IT components, equipment, and supplies

#### **Integration Points:**
- **‚Üí TO Asset**: Supplies equipment for deployment and maintenance components
- **‚Üê FROM Procurement**: Receives and catalogs all delivered materials
- **‚Üí TO Request**: Provides real-time availability for immediate fulfillment
- **‚Üí TO Procurement**: Auto-triggers purchase orders at minimum stock levels

#### **Key Business Logic:**
- **Stock Management**: Automated reorder levels with seasonal adjustments
- **Deployment Workflow**: Available ‚Üí Reserved ‚Üí Deployed ‚Üí (In Use/Returned)
- **Cost Optimization**: Weighted average costing with supplier performance tracking
- **Quality Control**: Condition tracking (New/Used/Refurbished/Damaged)

### **3. REQUEST MODULE - Demand Orchestration Authority**
**Core Responsibility**: Centralized processing and intelligent routing of all IT requests

#### **Integration Points:**
- **‚Üí TO Inventory**: Real-time availability verification before processing
- **‚Üí TO Asset**: Links requests to specific assets for lifecycle management
- **‚Üí TO Procurement**: Auto-generates purchase requests when inventory insufficient
- **‚Üê FROM All Modules**: Receives status updates for complete visibility

#### **Key Business Logic:**
- **Intelligent Routing**: Request ‚Üí Check Inventory ‚Üí (Fulfill/Procure/Maintain)
- **Priority Management**: Critical/High/Medium/Low with SLA enforcement
- **Approval Workflows**: Tiered approvals based on value and impact
- **Automated Processing**: Standard requests processed without human intervention

### **4. PROCUREMENT MODULE - Acquisition Authority**
**Core Responsibility**: Streamlined acquisition of IT equipment, services, and supplies

#### **Integration Points:**
- **‚Üê FROM Inventory**: Responds to automated low-stock purchase triggers
- **‚Üê FROM Request**: Processes specific equipment and service requests
- **‚Üí TO Asset**: Creates asset records for all acquired equipment
- **‚Üí TO Inventory**: Updates stock immediately upon delivery confirmation

#### **Key Business Logic:**
- **Automated Procurement**: Inventory thresholds trigger purchase orders automatically
- **Vendor Management**: Performance-based vendor selection and rating
- **Budget Controls**: Multi-tier approval gates with budget tracking
- **Quality Assurance**: Delivery acceptance with automatic asset/inventory updates
