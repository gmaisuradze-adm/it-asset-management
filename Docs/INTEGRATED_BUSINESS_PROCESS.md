# Hospital IT Asset Tracking System - Integrated Business Process Flow

## üè• **N1 CRITICAL INTEGRATION MANDATE - MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY**

### **FOUR-MODULE UNIFIED OPERATION REQUIREMENT**

**This is the N1 critical requirement**: The Asset, Inventory/Warehouse, Request, and Procurement modules **MUST work together in complete harmony for maximum efficiency**. This is not a suggestion - it is the fundamental architectural principle that ensures:

1. **Streamlined IT equipment request processes** - Zero delays, zero redundancy
2. **Optimal business process design** - Maximum throughput with minimum effort  
3. **Maximum operational efficiency** - Real-time cross-module integration
4. **Unified data ecosystem** - Single source of truth across all operations

**Any deviation from this integrated approach will result in system failure to meet the hospital's critical IT asset management requirements.**
