# Warehouse/Inventory Module - Hospital Asset Tracking System

## üö® **N1 CRITICAL INTEGRATION MANDATE** üö®

### **Warehouse/Inventory Module: Supply Chain Authority in Four-Module Maximum Efficiency System**

**This Warehouse/Inventory Module is the supply chain management component of the N1 critical four-module integrated system.** It is architecturally designed to work in complete harmony with the other three modules and CANNOT function independently:

- **‚Üê‚Üí Asset Module**: Supplies equipment for deployment; receives components for maintenance operations
- **‚Üê‚Üí Request Module**: Provides real-time availability for all requests; fulfills approved requests immediately  
- **‚Üê‚Üí Procurement Module**: Receives all delivered materials; triggers purchase orders when stock levels are insufficient

### **Integration Requirements for Maximum Efficiency:**
- **Real-time stock visibility** - All modules have instant access to current inventory levels
- **Automatic replenishment triggers** - Stock thresholds automatically initiate procurement processes
- **Seamless deployment workflows** - Request fulfillment happens instantly when inventory is available
- **Complete traceability** - Every item movement is tracked from receipt through deployment to final destination

**CRITICAL**: This Warehouse/Inventory Module is designed as the supply chain backbone of the integrated four-module system. Operating it independently will result in failure to achieve the N1 requirement of maximum operational efficiency and streamlined IT equipment processes.
